# Drop It Like it's Hot: Where Network Pruning Meets Data Selection
We introduce a novel framework that jointly leverages coreset selectionâ€”guided by forgetting scores and structured network pruning to streamline training and inference.

## This Repository Contains the Following:
* The models we used to run our experiments
    * Resnet18
    * Resnet50
    * LeNet
    * FCNet
* Our forgettability score implementation coupled with one-shot pruning
* The results of our experiments (csv file accuracies) on:
    * CIFAR10
    * CIFAR100
    * MNIST
* A script that we used to run our experiments
